# hearthstone-genesis

hearthstone-genesis is a random card generator for Hearthstone, written in Python.
It uses premade templates (known from the game) and sticks them together to create new, unique cards. Contributions of all kind are welcome!

This project was started by drusepth, now I'm taking my try on developing it further.
